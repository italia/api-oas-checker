      Cache usage SHOULD be extensively detailed in the `description` property

      to avoid data leaks or the usage of stale data.


      This rule should ensure in some way that the api provider

      documented extensively the cache usage to avoid data leaks

      or usage of stale data.

      The `no-transform` directive can

      be used in responses to avoid transforming proxies to

      modify (eg. compress) the content.


      For now this ruleset tests:

      * the presence of following keywords
        in the `description`: `max-age`, `private`, `no-store`, `no-cache`,
        `no-transform`.
      * that one and only one between Expires and Cache-Control is used.


      `Cache-Control` and `Expires` should not be used in conjuction,

      because `Cache-Control` overrides `Expires` when `max-age` is set.

      Instead if neither `Cache-Control` or `Expires` are set, clients MAY use euristic cache

      like described in RFC7234.

      When you design a REST API, you don't usually need to mention terms like

      `get`, `delete` and so on in your `paths`, because this information is

      conveyed by the HTTP method.


      Instead of using


      ```

      POST /books/1234/delete HTTP/1.1

      Host: api.example

      ```


      You can simply call


      ```

      DELETE /books/1234 HTTP/1.1

      Host: api.example

      ```


      Similarly you don't need verbs like `list` or `create` because

      the HTTP Semantics RFC7231 supports this kind of actions natively

      with proper methods and status code.


      Instead of


      ```

      POST /create/user HTTP/1.1

      Host: api.example

      Content-Type: application/json


      {"given_name": "Mario"}

      ```


      You can use

      ```

      POST /create/user HTTP/1.1

      Host: api.example

      Content-Type: application/json


      {"given_name": "Mario"}

      ```


      returning a proper response


      ```

      HTTP/1.1 201 Created

      Location: /users/1234


      ```


      This simplifies securing your API as you know beforehand the kind of action

      which is going to be performed.

      Enforcing a consistent schema for errors between different APIs,
      enables client to properly implement an error management strategy,
      with positive impacts for users.

      Errors should return RFC7807 objects. Instead, this schema
      seems to use non standard properties such as:
      `message`, `msg` and `code`.

      An error of the following form

      ```
      {
        "msg": "Book with id: 123 does not exist.",
        "code": 6063
      }
      ```

      can be expressed in RFC7807 with

      ```
      {
        "detail": "Book with id: 123 does not exist.",
        "type": "https://api.example/v1/errors/6063",
        "status": 404,
        "title": "Not Found"
      }
      ```

      Returning an URI in `type`, instead of an opaque `code` can help
      the client in better identifying the error; moreover the URI
      though it should not be dereferenced automatically, can return
      an actual resource providing guidance in addressing the issue.

      When a client is either:
      * throttled out with a 429 status code;
      * warned about a temporary server issue with a 503 status code;
      the server should explicitly communicate how long to wait
      before issuing further requests using the Retry-After header.

      Retry-After is defined in RFC7231.

      Ratelimiting API preserves a service and limits attack scenario

      [see API4:2019 Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security).


      APIs should use the following headers at least on successful responses:

      - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: number of total requests in a give time window

      - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: remaining requests in the current window

      - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: number of seconds before the window resets


      An example set of headers is the following


      ```

      X-Ratelimit-Limit: 100

      X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 40

      X-Ratelimit-Reset: 12

      ```


      A standardization proposal for ratelimit headers is ongoning

      inside the IETF HTTPAPI Workgroup.

      JSON responses MUST use JSON objects, in order to be extensible.

      For example, instead of a list `[1, 2, 3]` you should return
      an object `{"items": [1, 2, 3]}`.

      This allows the schema to evolve in a backward compatible ways.
