    description: |-
      Paths should be protected by a `security` rule, especially when they
      are tied to non-idempotent HTTP methods like `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.

      You should define a security rule tied to a `securityScheme`, eg.

      ```
      paths:
        /books:
          post:
            security:
            - BasicAuth: []
      securitySchemes:
        BasicAuth:
          scheme: http
          type: basic
      ```
    message: >-
      The path {{path}} is not protected.
    formats:
    - oas3
    severity: info
    recommended: true
    given:
    - >-
      $.paths.*.get
    then:
    - field: security
      function: truthy
  security-protection-non-idempotent:
    <<: *security-protection-get
    message: >-
      The non-idempotent operation {{path}} is not protected
    severity: error
    given:
      - >-
        $.paths.*[?(@property.match(/^(post|put|patch|delete)/))]
