    description: |-
      Your API should be protected by a `security` rule either at
      global or operation level.
      Operations should be protected specially when they
      are tied to non-idempotent HTTP methods like `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.
      This is done with one or more non-empty `security` rules.

      Security rules are defined in the `securityScheme` section.

      An example of a security rule applied at global level.

      ```
      security:
      - BasicAuth: []
      paths:
        /books: {}
        /users: {}
      securitySchemes:
        BasicAuth:
          scheme: http
          type: basic
      ```

      An example of a security rule applied at operation level, which
      eventually overrides the global one

      ```
      paths:
        /books:
          post:
            security:
            - AccessToken: []
      securitySchemes:
        BasicAuth:
          scheme: http
          type: basic
        AccessToken:
          scheme: http
          type: bearer
          bearerFormat: JWT
      ```

      Json Web Tokens RFC7519 is a compact, URL-safe means of representing
      claims to be transferred between two parties. JWT can be enclosed in
      encrypted or signed tokens like JWS and JWE.

      The [JOSE IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/jose/jose.xhtml)
      provides algorithms information.

      RFC8725 describes common pitfalls in the JWx specifications and in
      their implementations, such as:
      - the ability to ignore algorithms, eg. `{"alg": "none"}`;
      - using insecure algorithms like `RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5` eg. `{"alg": "RS256"}`.

      An API using JWT should explicit in the `description`
      that the implementation conforms to RFC8725.
