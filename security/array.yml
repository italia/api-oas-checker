      Array size should be limited to mitigate resource exhaustion attacks.
      This can be done using `maxItems` and `minItems`, like in the example
      below.

      ```
      Limited:
        type: array
        maxItems: 10
        items:
          type: string
          format: date
      ```

      You should ensure that the schema referenced in  `items` is constrained too.

      If you delegate input validation to a library or framework,
      be sure to test it thoroughly and ensure that it verifies `maxItems`.

    then:
    - field: maxItems
      function: defined
    - field: minItems
