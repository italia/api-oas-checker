      Check if the operation is protected at operation level.
      Otherwise, the global `#/security` property is check.

      Your API should be protected by a `security` rule either at
      global or operation level.
      All operations should be protected especially when they
      not safe (methods that do not alter the state of the server) 
      HTTP methods like `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE`.
      This is done with one or more non-empty `security` rules.

      Security rules are defined in the `securityScheme` section.

      An example of a security rule applied at global level.

      ```
      security:
      - BasicAuth: []
      paths:
        /books: {}
        /users: {}
      securitySchemes:
        BasicAuth:
          scheme: http
          type: basic
      ```

      An example of a security rule applied at operation level, which
      eventually overrides the global one

      ```
      paths:
        /books:
          post:
            security:
            - AccessToken: []
      securitySchemes:
        BasicAuth:
          scheme: http
          type: basic
        AccessToken:
          scheme: http
          type: bearer
          bearerFormat: JWT
      ```
