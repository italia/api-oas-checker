      Error management is a key enabler of a resilient API ecosystem.
      Enforcing a consistent schema for errors between different APIs,
      enables client to properly implement an error management strategy,
      with positive impacts for users.

      Error responses should return one of the media-type
      defined in RFC7807:
      - `application/problem+json`
      - `application/problem+xml`

      An example of a valid response:

      ```
      responses:
        "503":
          content:
            application/problem+json:
              schema:
                ...
      ```

      Enforcing a consistent schema for errors between different APIs,
      enables client to properly implement an error management strategy,
      with positive impacts for users.

      This rule inspects the schema returned by an error response and
      verifies whether it contains the main properties defined in RFC7807:
      `status`, `title` and `detail`.

      An example of a valid payload is
      ```
      {
       "title": "Not Found",
       "status": 404,
       "detail": "Book does not exist; id: 123"
      }

      Enforcing a consistent schema for errors between different APIs,
      enables client to properly implement an error management strategy,
      with positive impacts for users.

      Errors should return RFC7807 objects. Instead, this schema
      seems to use non standard properties such as:
      `message`, `msg` and `code`.

      An error of the following form

      ```
      {
        "msg": "Book with id: 123 does not exist.",
        "code": 6063
      }
      ```

      can be expressed in RFC7807 with

      ```
      {
        "detail": "Book with id: 123 does not exist.",
        "type": "https://api.example/v1/errors/6063",
        "status": 404,
        "title": "Not Found"
      }
      ```

      Returning an URI in `type`, instead of an opaque `code` can help
      the client in better identifying the error; moreover the URI
      though it should not be dereferenced automatically, can return
      an actual resource providing guidance in addressing the issue.
