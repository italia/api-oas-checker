      The PATCH specification explicits that the request body contains
      a "patch document" describing the changes to be applied
      to the target resource.

      To avoid confusion, [this errata](https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid3169)
      explains that `application/json` is not an appropriate media-type for `PATCH`.

      A correct example of PATCH using eg. `application/json-patch+json` media-type
      defined in RFC6902.

      ```
      paths:
        /books/{book_id}:
          patch:
            requestBody:
              content:
                application/json-patch+json:
                  schema:
                    type: object
                  example: [{ "op": "add", "path": "/baz", "value": "qux" }]
      ```
