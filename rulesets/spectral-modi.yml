            This rule should ensure in some way that the api provider
            documented extensively the cache usage to avoid data leaks
            or usage of stale data.
            The `no-transform` directive can
            be used in responses to avoid transforming proxies to
            modify (eg. compress) the content.

            * the presence of following keywords
              in the `description`: `max-age`, `private`, `no-store`, `no-cache`,
              `no-transform`.
            * that one and only one between Expires and Cache-Control is used.

            `Cache-Control` and `Expires` should not be used in conjunction,
            because `Cache-Control` overrides `Expires` when `max-age` is set.
            Instead if neither `Cache-Control` or `Expires` are set, clients MAY use heuristic cache
            like described in RFC7234.

            Ratelimiting an API preserves a service and limits attack scenario
            [see API4:2019 Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security).

            APIs should use the following headers at least on successful responses:
            - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: number of total requests in a give time window
            - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: remaining requests in the current window
            - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: number of seconds before the window resets

            An example set of headers is the following

            ```
            X-Ratelimit-Limit: 100
            X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 40
            X-Ratelimit-Reset: 12
            ```

            A standardization proposal for ratelimit headers is ongoing
            inside the IETF HTTPAPI Workgroup.
